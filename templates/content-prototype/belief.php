<h1>It's More Than Just Work</h1>
<h2>It's who we are.</h2>

<section class="principles">
  <h1>Principled Work</h1>
  <p>The way we build reflects what we believe, who we wish to be, and why we get up in the morning.</p>
<!--I'd like to see us include links to blog articles concerning each of these principles.	-->
  <dl>
    <dt>Built Right</dt>
      <dd>Well-crafted work is valuable work. It embraces details, intentionality, and standards.</dd>
    <dt>Solve Problems</dt>
      <dd>Asking right questions of real problems drives work that produces true results.</dd>
    <dt>Content is Paramount</dt>
      <dd>The web exists to communicate message and provide function &mdash; these shall be our primary interests.</dd>
    <dt>Design for Clarity</dt>
      <dd>Design should compliment message and never obstruct users from it.</dd>
    <dt>Embrace All Devices</dt>
      <dd>The measure of a site should be its quality of build, not its dimensions.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>We all appreciate working with those that stand on principle. Let us tell you about <a href="working-with-sparkbox.php">working with us</a>.</p>

  <h1>A Principled Team</h1>
  <p>The only real thing we have to offer is us. It's not what we do &mdash; it's how we do it.</p>
  <!--I'd like to see us include links to blog articles concerning each of these principles.	-->
    <dl>
    <dt>First Things First</dt>
      <dd>Work hard by ultimately working for community, family, and faith.</dd>
    <dt>Never Stop Learning</dt>
      <dd>Mastery is an ever-changing target, but we pursue it with a daily hunger.</dd>
    <dt>Constant Collaboration</dt>
      <dd>Band together across disciplines, client and teammate alike, for richer solutions.</dd>
    <dt>Lead By Example</dt>
      <dd>Raising the bar for oneself benefits every project and person then touched.</dd>
    <dt>Do What You Love</dt>
      <dd>Passion is infectious, and it produces a joy that spreads to work and team.</dd>

  <p>What does a team like this look like? <a href="team.php">See for yourself.</a></p>
