  <h2><a href="#">Stry.Us Long-Form News Website</a></h2>
  <p><a href="http://stry.us">Go to stry.us</a></p>
  <p>Working with Stry on a ground-up brand and website overhaul was one of those rare occasions where the client hands over near complete creative control. The direction from Stry founder, <a href="#">Dan Oshinsky</a>, was pretty much, "Make the most beautiful news website ever made." Stop by Stry.us for a look around. Be sure to set aside some time, however, because even if the beautiful, responsive design eventually loses your attention, the rich long-form articles will keep you there for hours. </p>
